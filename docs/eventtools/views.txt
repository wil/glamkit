calendar
========

This view is for displaying metadata about calendars. Upcoming events, name, description and so on. This is probably not the best view for displaying a calendar in a traditional sense, i.e. displaying a month calendar or a year calendar, as it does not equip the context with any period objects. If you would like to do this you should use calendar_by_period.

Required Arguments
------------------

``request``
    As always the request object.

``calendar_slug``
    The slug of the calendar to be displayed.

Optional Arguments
------------------

``template_name``
    default
        'events/calendar.html'
    
    This is the template that will be rendered.

Context Variables
-----------------

``calendar``
    The Calendar object designated by the ``calendar_slug``.

calendar_by_period
==================

This view is for getting a calendar, but also getting periods with that
calendar.  Which periods you get is designated with the list ``periods``. You
can designate which date you want the periods to be initialised to, by passing
a date in ``request.GET``. See the template tag ``query_string_for_date``.

Required Arguments
------------------

``request``
    As always the request object.

``calendar_slug``
    The slug of the calendar to be displayed.

Optional Arguments
------------------

``template_name``
    default
        'events/calendar_by_period    .html'
    
    This is the template that will be rendered.

``periods``
    default
        ``[]``
    
    This is a list of period subclasses that designates which periods you would like to instantiate and put in the context.
    
Context Variables
-----------------

``date``
    This was the date that was generated from the query string.

``periods``
    This is a dictionary that returns the periods from the list you passed
    in.  If you passed in Month and Day, then your dictionary would look
    like this
    
    ::
    
        {
            'month': <events.periods.Month object>
            'day':   <events.periods.Day object>
        }

    So in the template to access the Day period in the context you simply
    use ``periods.day``.

``calendar``
    This is the Calendar that is designated by the ``calendar_slug``.

``weekday_names``
    This is for convenience. It returns the local names of weekdays for
    internationalization.
